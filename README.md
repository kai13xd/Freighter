# Okay, what's Freighter?

### Hey there, Kai here.

Freighter is toolkit made for compiling C, C++, or ASM using DevkitPPC for injecting new code/data sections into GameCube/Wii \*.dol executables. This is an extension of Yoshi2's C-Kit I worked on around middle of 2019 because I was abhorred with the methods modders used abusing C.

The OG who made C-kit. He enthused about Python so I had no choice but to learn it.

 This man helped me ALOT way back when I was first learning C++. He originally had the idea of using the `#pragma` keyword where C-kit would preprocess the source file and import the injection address.

# How do install?

### Make sure you are using the latest version of [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After that, simply install using `pip` on your console of choice:

- Windows: `py -m pip install freighter`
- Unix & Such: `python3 -m pip install freighter`

Dependencies should automatically be downloaded from PyPi.

## Optionals

- [Window's Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal): It's a nice command-line manager that looks modern, has tabs, and support of emoji unicode characters. ✨
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): My go to code editor. Supports Intellisense and it's what I exclusively use. It's got a huge list of extensions that make coding a breeze.

 **[Yoshi2 (RenolY2)](https://github.com/RenolY2)**: The OG who made C-kit who made alot of the tools for Pikmin 2 and MKDD. He helped raise baby Kai when he was first learning hex and figuring out how pointers worked. He made a ton of tools that operate on Gamecube era gamefiles and really made the modding scene pop off. Thank you!

**[Minty Meeo](https://github.com/Minty-Meeo)**: Mostly found around the Pikmin 1 scene but recently has been working on stuff on Pikmin 2. He has made alot of great changes to C-kit such as relocating the stack frame and cleaning up the code for injection hooks.

**YoshiFirebird**: This man helped me ALOT way back when I was first learning C++. He originally had the nice idea of using the `#pragma` keyword where C-kit would preprocess the source file and import the injection address wherever it found it. Saved time having to backtrack to the build.py when I wanted to adjust the codecave site. Also doesn't make intellisense yell at you hah.

# What next?

Next just create a `build.py` inside your work directory and import the `Project` class.

# Example build.py

> ### 🛎️**NOTE:  Freighter does it's best to fetch include and source folders found in the root folder. All source files found will be auto-imported into the project for compilation.**

Better documentation will come.. when I feel like it.
